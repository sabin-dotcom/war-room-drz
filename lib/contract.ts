=== DEAL HISTORY & BACKGROUND (from Sabin's voice memo) ===

HOW SABIN AND DRZ MET:
- Sabin met Dr. Mohammed Zamakhshary (DRZ) through Dr. OZ (not Rose - it's Dr. Oz who is now in the Trump administration)
- Dr. OZ introduced them and suggested they collaborate
- Dr. OZ said: "If you want to do AI in Saudi Arabia, you should meet Dr. Zamakhshary"

WHO IS DR. ZAMAKHSHARY (DRZ):
- Former surgeon with WORLD RECORDS in Siamese twin separation operations
- Trained in Canada
- Called back by Saudi government, became Deputy Minister of Health
- Half Egyptian (mother is Egyptian) - has Egyptian business connections
- Now has a training company in the Diplomatic Quarter (requires government approval to even buy property there)
- EXTREMELY connected: knows ministers, secretaries of state, deputy ministers
- Has medical training contracts with the Saudi government

THE WECARE STORY:
- DRZ wanted to localize WeCare/ShareCare (American platform) for Saudi Arabia
- Had 2-3 bad experiences with companies from Dubai, India, and Australia
- Then engaged Răzvan Costin (Sabin's former CTO/partner in outsourcing)
- Zamakhshary paid €450,000 to Răzvan for WeCare localization
- Sabin facilitated this - money went through him to Răzvan
- This was in Spring 2025

RĂZVAN COSTIN'S FAILURE:
- Had 6 months to deliver but "the mobile app code was absolute garbage"
- Team "did absolutely nothing" productive
- "The app feels terrible, doesn't produce results"
- Sabin: "Răzvan's team - I was ashamed of everything"

THE NGOSH PARTNERSHIP:
- NGOSH = National Occupational Safety and Health (government agency)
- Led by Engineer Majid
- Has power to ensure all companies comply with safety regulations
- Deal structure: DRZ privately finances, creates institute, develops AI products
- Partnership split: 70% for Zamakhshary's JV / 30% for NGOSH (government)
- Business model: Companies MUST report workplace incidents. Either hire consultants + use complex platforms, OR use the JV's AI products

THE PIVOT TO EDWARD:
- In Fall 2025, Sabin partnered with Edward ("Bedouard") 
- Edward closed his similar company to join Humans
- Built modern clone of WeCare with latest technology
- Developed AI Investigation platform
- Estimated revenue potential: €50 million (1+ million companies in Saudi Arabia)

THE 7 PRODUCTS REQUEST:
- NGOSH requested 7 AI products
- Sabin tried to build them with Răzvan's team - "they did absolutely nothing"
- Edward's team actually delivered: AI Investigation, AI Training Center, AI Counselor, etc.

THE BUDGET DISPUTE:
- Original agreement: €123,000 per month
- Răzvan was asking €90,000/month just for WeCare maintenance
- This would leave Sabin only €30,000 to build 7 products - IMPOSSIBLE
- Sabin suggested doing it with Edward instead, cutting out Răzvan

RĂZVAN GOES ROGUE:
- Răzvan went behind Sabin's back
- Wrote directly to Zamakhshary
- Offered: €80,000/month for WeCare app + €20,000/month bonus = €100,000/month total
- Threatened to "delete everything" if not paid €200,000
- Zamakhshary contacted Răzvan directly without telling Sabin
- This is betrayal - Răzvan was Sabin's CTO, introduced to Zamakhshary by Sabin

THE EGYPTIAN COMPANY:
- An Egyptian company cloned Humans' AI Training platform
- They presented it to NGOSH/Engineer Majid as their own product
- Zamakhshary signed with them (claims Majid forced him)
- DRZ is half Egyptian, has Egyptian business connections
- Sabin: "They produced a clone of our AI Investigation app - a terrible clone"

DRZ'S HEDGING STRATEGY ("EGGS IN DIFFERENT BASKETS"):
- AI Investigation: with Humans/Sabin
- AI Training Center: given to Egyptians  
- WeCare: still dealing with Răzvan
- DRZ is diversifying risk across multiple partners
- If one fails, he has others

THE CONTRACT PROBLEMS:
- Abusive clauses: drag-along, tag-along heavily in DRZ's favor
- 3-year exclusivity on AI in Saudi Arabia - but NO budget commitment
- Budget to be decided "in first board meeting" = ZERO commitment
- DRZ's lawyers (Amr & Partners - Egyptian firm) trying to remove all Humans protections
- They want to delete the €246k outstanding debt
- They rejected Appendix 5 (exit protection) entirely
- They rejected English law/LCIA arbitration

SABIN'S CONCERNS:
- "I'm not afraid that he'll take me to Saudi and then drop me - I'll still have a name"
- "I'm afraid he'll keep me CAPTIVE - if the Egyptians work out, he keeps me blocked in exclusivity"
- "3 years stuck in a golden cage"
- DRZ wants to own everything, not transparent, playing power games

THE RELATIONSHIP:
- DRZ visited Romania twice
- Sabin organized his trips, DRZ came to Sabin's home
- They had a BBQ with families
- Good personal relationship, but unclear what DRZ is pursuing
- DRZ said he wants to invest in the company and be partners
- But actions don't match words
